# Special Nights In 
Do you ever find that celebrating a special occasion while staying at home just doesn't feel so special? 

Today, there are many reasons why people are celebrating with nights in rather than nights out, ranging from: accessibility concerns for persons with disabilities; to budgetary concerns about the high cost of eating out; to safety concerns about exposure to COVID-19. 

Whatever your concerns, you can now find the perfect combination of a special cocktail recipe, and a special meal recipe, to make your loved ones feel special on those special occasions spent at home!
